# Math Sprint

A timed Python math game that tests speed and accuracy.

## How It Works

- 10 problems per round
- Timer tracks completion time
- High score saved for perfect runs
- Record updates only if all answers are correct

python math_sprint.py
```
## Files
Highscore.txt stores the best completion time

## Output
